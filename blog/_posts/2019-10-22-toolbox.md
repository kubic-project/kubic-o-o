## Intro

Our Container Host OS [openSUSE MicroOS](https://en.opensuse.org/Kubic:MicroOS)
and our Kubernetes platform [openSUSE Kubic](https://kubic.opensuse.org) are
both using
[transactional-update](https://kubic.opensuse.org/documentation/transactional-update-guide/tu-introduction.html)
to apply patches to the system. This implies that a read-only root filesystem
is used. While this has big advantages, like it allows to update a cluster
automatically in a safe way, this has one drawback: you need to reboot to
activate new installed packages.
But what if you want to debug a problem and the utility you need is not
installed? Who says, that the problem is still debuggable after a reboot?

For this, we introduced now the `toolbox` utilitiy with a `toolbox container`.

## toolbox - bring your own tools with you

`toolbox` is a small script that launches a privileged container to let you
bring in your favorite debugging or admin tools in such a system. If the
container does not contain the utility you need, you can install whatever you
want with `zypper`. `toolbox` is stateful, if you quit the script and start it
later again, the environment is in the exactly same state as when you left
it. To reset it, the container image needs to be deleted:
`podman rm toolbox-<user>`.
The root filesystem can be found at `/media/root`.

### Usage

```
$ /usr/bin/toolbox
Spawning a container 'toolbox-root' with image 'registry.opensuse.org/opensuse/toolbox'
51e475f05d8bb8a5bf110bbecd960383bf8cfade1569587edef92076215f0eba
toolbox-root
Container started successfully. To exit, type 'exit'.
toolbox:/ # ls -alF /media/root
...
toolbox:/ # tcpdump -i ens3
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
listening on ens3, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 65535 bytes
...
toolbox:/ # zypper in vim

The following 5 NEW packages are going to be installed:
  libgdbm6 libgdbm_compat4 perl vim vim-data-common

5 new packages to install.
Overall download size: 9.0 MiB. Already cached: 0 B. After the operation,
additional 49.4 MiB will be used.

toolbox:/ # vi /media/root/etc/passwd
```

### Advanced Usage

#### Use a custom image

toolbox uses an openSUSE-based userspace environment called `opensuse/toolbox`
by default, but this can be changed to any container image. Simply override
environment variables in `$HOME/.toolboxrc`, where every entry is optional:

##### toolbox configuration file

```
# cat ~/.toolboxrc
REGISTRY=registry.opensuse.org
IMAGE=opensuse/toolbox:latest
TOOLBOX_NAME=special-debug-container
TOOLBOX_SHELL="/bin/bash"
```

#### Root container as normal user

toolbox called by a normal user will start the toolbox container, too, but the root filesystem cannot be modified. Running toolbox with sudo has the disadvantage, that the .toolboxrc from root and not the user is used. To run the toolbox container with root rights, `toolbox --root` has to be used.

#### Automatically enter toolbox on login

Set an `/etc/passwd` entry for one of the users to `/usr/bin/toolbox`:

```
useradd bob -m -s /usr/bin/toolbox
```

Now when SSHing into the system as that user, toolbox will automatically be started:

```
# ssh bob@hostname.example.com
Last login: Thu Oct  3 16:52:16 2019 from 192.168.107.1
.toolboxrc file detected, overriding defaults...
Container 'toolbox-bob' already exists. Trying to start...
(To remove the container and start with a fresh toolbox, run: podman rm 'toolbox-bob')
toolbox-bob
Container started successfully. To exit, type 'exit'.
toolbox:/ #
```
