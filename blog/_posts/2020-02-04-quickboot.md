Not only in development environments it's very handy to have a quick turnaround time,
which can include reboots. Especially for transactional systems where changes to the
system only take effect after booting into the new state, this can have a significant
impact.

So let's see what can be done. Remember: "The difference between screwing around and
science is writing it down"!

## Starting point

Starting point for this experiment is a VM (KVM), 4GiB RAM, 2 CPU cores, no EFI.
Tumbleweed was installed as Server (textmode) with just defaults.

```
# systemd-analyze
Startup finished in 1.913s (kernel) + 2.041s (initrd) + 22.104s (userspace) = 25.958s
```

Almost 26 seconds just to get to the login prompt of a pretty minimal system,
that's not great. What can we do?

## Low-hanging fruit

systemd-analyze blame tells us what the worst offenders are:

```
# systemd-analyze blame --no-pager
18.769s btrfsmaintenance-refresh.service    
17.027s wicked.service                      
 3.170s plymouth-quit.service               
 3.170s plymouth-quit-wait.service          
 1.078s postfix.service                     
 1.023s apparmor.service                    
  839ms systemd-udev-settle.service         
  601ms systemd-logind.service              
  532ms firewalld.service
```

`btrfsmaintenance-refresh.service` is a bit special: It calls `systemctl` during execution
to enable/disable and start/stop the btrfs-\*.timer units. Those depend on `time-sync.target`, which itself needs `network.service` through `chronyd.service`.
`wicked.service` is the next item on the list. Before the unit is considered `active`, it tries
to fully configure and setup all configured interfaces, which includes DHCPv4 and v6 by default.
This is directly used as state for `network.service` and thus `network.target`.
There is no distinction between `network.service` and `network-online.target` by wicked.
To make the bootup quicker, switching to NetworkManager is an option,
which interprets `network.service` in a more async way and thus is much quicker to reach the `active` state.
Note that with DHCP, switching between wicked and NM might result in a different IP address!

```
# zypper install NetworkManager
# systemctl disable wicked
Removed /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/wicked.service.
Removed /etc/systemd/system/network.service.
Removed /etc/systemd/system/network-online.target.wants/wicked.service.
Removed /etc/systemd/system/dbus-org.opensuse.Network.Nanny.service.
Removed /etc/systemd/system/dbus-org.opensuse.Network.AUTO4.service.
Removed /etc/systemd/system/dbus-org.opensuse.Network.DHCP4.service.
Removed /etc/systemd/system/dbus-org.opensuse.Network.DHCP6.service.
# systemctl enable NetworkManager
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/network.service â†’ /usr/lib/systemd/system/NetworkManager.service.
```

Let's also remove plymouth - except for eyecandy it does not provide any useful features.

```
# zypper rm -u plymouth
Reading installed packages...
Resolving package dependencies...

The following 23 packages are going to be REMOVED:
  gnu-unifont-bitmap-fonts libdatrie1 libdrm2 libfribidi0 libgraphite2-3 libharfbuzz0 libpango-1_0-0 libply5 libply-boot-client5 libply-splash-core5 libply-splash-graphics5 libthai0 libthai-data libXft2 plymouth plymouth-branding-openSUSE
  plymouth-dracut plymouth-plugin-label plymouth-plugin-label-ft plymouth-plugin-two-step plymouth-scripts plymouth-theme-bgrt plymouth-theme-spinner

23 packages to remove.
After the operation, 4.8 MiB will be freed.
Continue? [y/n/v/...? shows all options] (y):
...
```

Plymouth is still started in the initrd, but as it's not part of the root filesystem anymore
it's not stopped by `plymouth-quit.service`. This combination would result in a broken boot!
Normally, the initrd should be regenerated automatically if anything relevant changes,
but for removals that's not implemented ([boo#966057](https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=966057)).

```
# mkinitrd
...
# reboot
...
```

Let's see how much time this saved:

```
# systemd-analyze
Startup finished in 1.675s (kernel) + 2.066s (initrd) + 2.696s (userspace) = 6.438s
```

Over 19s saved, that's quite a lot already!

```
# systemd-analyze blame --no-pager
1.411s btrfsmaintenance-refresh.service    
893ms systemd-logind.service              
849ms apparmor.service
```

Now the biggest contributor to the bootup time is btrfsmaintenance-refresh.service.
As it is not quite clear how much value it provides with a recent kernel
([boo#1063638#c106](https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1063638#c106)),
let's just remove it.

```
# zypper rm -u btrfsmaintenance
# reboot
...
# systemd-analyze
Startup finished in 1.700s (kernel) + 2.010s (initrd) + 2.367s (userspace) = 6.079s
multi-user.target reached after 2.347s in userspace
```

That's a bit better again.

```
# systemd-analyze blame --no-pager
873ms apparmor.service                    
550ms systemd-logind.service              
504ms postfix.service                     
405ms firewalld.service
```

Both `apparmor` and `systemd-logind.service` are needed, so no low hanging fruit remain.

## Accelerating early boot

There's still one part remaining in the boot time equation we can completely eliminate!

```
Startup finished in 1.700s (kernel) + 2.010s (initrd) + 2.367s (userspace) = 6.079s
                                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

So, what exactly is the initrd for anyway?
In the vast majority of installations, it's very clearly defined: Mount the real root filesystem
and switch to it. Depending on the configuration, this can range from simple (local ext4) to very
complex (encrypted block device over the network accepting the password over ssh).
Additionally, the kernel binary as loaded by the bootloader is very small, so does not include
drivers for every system. Those are part of modules included in the initrd.

Turns out, in simple cases (the majority of VM guest systems) we can boot without initrd just fine.
The current setup is not tuned for this setup though, so a few adjustments are required.

### Drivers for mounting / without loading modules

The kernel needs drivers for both the virtual devices connecting to the storage device and for the
filesystem on it.
The former part is dealt with by using the `kernel-kvmsmall` flavor, but unfortunately it does not
have btrfs built-in.

Fortunately, this is easy to fix by rebuilding the kernel with a custom config. By putting
`CONFIG_FS_BTRFS=y` (and some other required options) into `config.addon.tar.bz2` next to the standard
openSUSE kernel in OBS, it spits out an .rpm with a working binary.

```
# zypper ar obs://devel:kubic:quickboot/ devel:kubic:quickboot
# zypper in --from devel:kubic:quickboot kernel-kvmsmall
```

`kernel-kvmsmall` does not have all kernel features enabled (not even as modules), which means that in
some cases it might be necessary to apply the changes on `kernel-default` instead, which has a complete
set of modules.

### Mounting root by UUID

However, if you now reboot and comment out the `initrd` command in the grub config, you will notice
that the boot fails as the kernel is unable to find the root device. This is because by default,
the GRUB configuration uses `root=UUID=deadbeef-1234...` as parameter. This is interpreted by the
initrd in userspace. To be exact, when a block device is recognized by the kernel, Udev reacts by
reading the filesystem UUID and creating a link in `/dev/disk/by-uuid/...` which is then used as root device.
Without an initrd, that does not happen and the kernel is unable to continue.

Workaround here is to set `GRUB_DISABLE_LINUX_UUID=true` in `/etc/default/grub`. This means that device paths
like `root=/dev/vda2` are used, which can lead to issues when changing the disk layout or order.
By additionally setting `GRUB_DISABLE_LINUX_PARTUUID=false`, it uses `root=PARTUUID=cafebabe-4554...` which is
supported by the kernel as well, but is more reliable.

```
# echo GRUB_DISABLE_LINUX_UUID=true >> /etc/default/grub
# echo GRUB_DISABLE_LINUX_PARTUUID=false >> /etc/default/grub
# grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
# reboot
... (comment out the initrd call in grub, after pressing "e" in the menu and prepending "#" in the last line)
# systemd-analyze
Startup finished in 1.778s (kernel) + 2.725s (userspace) = 4.504s
```

Almost a third shaved off again, awesome!
However, there are now error messages shown in the console, which is not that awesome.
Something about `systemd-gpt-auto-generator` and `systemd-remount-fs` being unable to find
the root device - just like the kernel earlier. The cause is actually the same - `/etc/fstab`
still contains the mounts in `UUID=` format and those errors happen before `systemd-udevd.service`
is started and udev has settled.

No matter how systemd is configured, it's not possible to get rid of the first error - generators
run before any units. So we have to start udev even before that - before systemd!

But first, a quick detour.

## Getting transactional

Let's take a look at how MicroOS is doing. As the name already says, it's supposed to be lighter than
plain Tumbleweed out of the box.

```
# systemd-analyze 
Startup finished in 1.788s (kernel) + 2.036s (initrd) + 21.243s (userspace) = 25.068s

# systemd-analyze blame --no-pager
17.669s btrfsmaintenance-refresh.service
16.177s wicked.service
 3.377s apparmor.service
 1.356s health-checker.service                
 1.179s systemd-udev-settle.service
  968ms systemd-logind.service
  811ms kdump.service
```

A second quicker, ok. Plymouth is gone, but we gained health-checker and kdump.
The time is dominated by wicked slowing down the startup though, so let's replace it.
Additionally, disable `btrfsmaintenance-refresh.service`. It's not possible to remove it
as the `microos_base` pattern requires it.

```
# transactional-update shell
transactional update # zypper install NetworkManager
transactional update # systemctl disable wicked
transactional update # systemctl enable NetworkManager
transactional update # systemctl disable btrfsmaintenance-refresh.service
transactional update # exit
# reboot
...
# systemd-analyze 
Startup finished in 1.744s (kernel) + 1.989s (initrd) + 2.342s (userspace) = 6.075s

# systemd-analyze blame
1.251s apparmor.service                    
1.066s kdump.service                       
 824ms NetworkManager-wait-online.service  
 742ms systemd-logind.service              
 730ms kdump-early.service                 
 638ms systemd-udevd.service               
 563ms create-dirs-from-rpmdb.service
```

Much better again.

## Booting a read only system without initrd

In a system with a read-only root filesystem like MicroOS (or transactional server), the initrd has
another task: Make sure that `/var` and `/etc` are mounted already, so that early boot can store logs
and read configuration.

So we actually have to mount `/var` and `/etc` before starting systemd. How? By having our own init
script! It is started directly by the kernel by setting `init=/sbin/init.noinitrd` and as last
step just does `exec /sbin/init` to replace itself as PID 1 with systemd.

Unfortunately it's not quite as easy as just doing `mount /var` and calling it a day, as the mount
for `/var` uses a `UUID=` as source, so it needs udev running... Luckily, udev actually works in that
environment, after mounting `/sys`, `/proc` and `/run` manually.

Here the circle closes - we have udev running before systemd now. So by just using the script we
need for read-only systems everywhere, that issue is solved too.

### Making initrd-less booting simpler

As the setup for initrd-less booting is quite complex, there's now a package which does the needed
setup automatically (except for installing a suitable kernel).

This contains the needed "pre-init" wrapper script `/sbin/init.noinitrd` as well as a grub configuration
module which automatically adds entries to boot the system without initrd. Those are only generated
for kernels which have support for the root filesystem built-in. It takes care of setting `root`/`rootflags`
and `init` parameters properly as well. The boot options with initrd are still there, as failsafe.

```
# zypper ar obs://devel:kubic:quickboot/openSUSE_Tumbleweed devel:kubic:quickboot
# transactional-update initrd shell pkg in --from devel:kubic:quickboot kernel-kvmsmall noinitrd
...
transactional update # grub2-set-default 0
transactional update # exit
# reboot
...

# systemd-analyze 
Startup finished in 1.889s (kernel) + 2.246s (userspace) = 4.135s

# systemd-analyze blame
1.022s apparmor.service                    
 847ms kdump.service                       
 820ms NetworkManager-wait-online.service  
 782ms systemd-logind.service              
 608ms kdump-early.service                 
 542ms dev-vda3.device
```

Just over 4 seconds! That the `/var` partition is now part of the top six on systemd-analyze
means that we're getting close to the limits.

### An issue with issue-generator

Booting without an initrd seems to have introduced a bug: Instead of showing the active
network interface `enp1s0` and its addresses, there's just a lonely `eth0:` on the login
screen. Checking the journal, this is because the interface got renamed from eth0 to enp1s0
during boot. Usually this happens when udev runs in the initrd already, which means that
after switch-root there's an `add` event with the new name already, which issue-generator
picks up. Without initrd, the rename happens in the booted system and issue-generator has to
handle that somehow.

How can this be implemented? To find out which udev events are triggered by a rename, the udev
monitor is very helpful. With the `--property` option it shows which properties are attached
to the triggered events:

```
# udevadm monitor --udev --property &
# ip link set lo down
# ip link set lo name lonew
# ip link set lonew name lo
...
UDEV  [630.458943] move     /devices/virtual/net/lo (net)
ACTION=move
DEVPATH=/devices/virtual/net/lo
SUBSYSTEM=net
DEVPATH_OLD=/devices/virtual/net/lonew
INTERFACE=lo
IFINDEX=1
SEQNUM=3616
USEC_INITIALIZED=1054433
ID_NET_LINK_FILE=/usr/lib/systemd/network/99-default.link
SYSTEMD_ALIAS=/sys/subsystem/net/devices/lonew /sys/subsystem/net/devices/lonew
TAGS=:systemd:
# fg
^C
# ip link set lo up
```

So using the `DEVPATH_OLD` and `INTERFACE` properties, the rename can be [implemented in
issue-generator's udev rules](https://github.com/thkukuk/issue-generator/pull/3):

After applying those changes and a reboot, enp1s0 is shown properly now!

## Optimizing apparmor.service

Those who paid attention to the output of `systemd-analyze blame` will have noticed
that compared to plain Tumbleweed, `apparmor.service` takes longer to start on MicroOS.
Why is that so?

```
# systemd-analyze plot > plot.svg
```

![systemd-analyze plot result](/assets/images/cdfrdb-plot.png)

In this plot it's possible to guess which explicit and also implicit dependencies there
are between services. If a service starts after a different service ends, it's probably
an explicit dependency. If a service is only up after a different service started, it's probably
waiting for it in some way. That's what we can see in the plot: `apparmor.service` only finished
startup after `create-dirs-from-rpmdb.service` started up. So getting that to start earlier or
quicker would accelerate `apparmor.service` as well.
To confirm this theory, just disable the service:

```
# systemctl disable create-dirs-from-rpmdb.service
# reboot
# systemd-analyze blame
927ms systemd-logind.service              
824ms NetworkManager-wait-online.service  
721ms kdump.service                       
689ms kdump-early.service                 
554ms apparmor.service
# systemctl enable create-dirs-from-rpmdb.service
```

Confirmed. So how can this be optimized properly?

The purpose of this service is to create directories owned by packages, which are not part
of the system snapshots. It orders itself between `local-fs.target` and
`systemd-tmpfiles-setup.service`. Some tmpfiles.d files might rely on packaged directories
being present, so it has to run before `systemd-tmpfiles-setup.service`. Except for changing
it to `RequiresMountsFor=/var /opt /srv` there isn't much potential for optimization.

However, instead of running on every boot, the service only has to be active if the set of packages
changed. Luckily, with rpm 4.15, a new method to ease such checks (`rpmdbCookie`) got implemented and 
it was easy to [make use of it in the service](https://github.com/openSUSE/transactional-update/pull/24/files). 
With this deployed, it only runs when necessary and otherwise just takes some time
to get the cookie from the rpm database:

```
# systemd-analyze blame
872ms NetworkManager-wait-online.service  
832ms systemd-logind.service              
811ms kdump.service                       
645ms dev-vda3.device                     
597ms kdump-early.service                 
526ms apparmor.service
# systemd-analyze blame | grep create-dirs-from-rpmdb
 52ms create-dirs-from-rpmdb.service
```

For some reason this doesn't always help though, sometimes `apparmor.service` is back at >1s,
so this needs some more investigation.

## rebootmgr

On top of the blame list we have `NetworkManager-wait-online.service`. This service can take a variable
amount of time depending on the network configration and the environment and is in most cases not needed
for getting services up and running. So what is currently pulling that into `multi-user.target`?

```
# systemd-analyze critical-chain
The time when unit became active or started is printed after the "@" character.
The time the unit took to start is printed after the "+" character.

multi-user.target @2.472s
â””â”€rebootmgr.service @2.284s +24ms
  â””â”€network-online.target @2.282s
    â””â”€NetworkManager-wait-online.service @1.311s +970ms
      â””â”€NetworkManager.service @1.246s +61ms
```

It's `rebootmgr.service`! The reason it orders itself `After=network-online.target` is that it can
directly communicate with etcd. However, support for that is currently disabled in rebootmgr anyway
and it appears to handle the case with no network connection on start just fine. So until that
change ends up in the package, let's just adjust that manually:

```
# systemctl edit --full rebootmgr.service
(Remove lines with network-online.target)
# reboot
```

Note that this doesn't really improve the perceived speed of booting as only `multi-user.target`
itself depended on it and sshd/getty are started before that already.
The critical chain to `multi-user.target` is now:

```
# systemd-analyze critical-chain
The time when unit became active or started is printed after the "@" character.
The time the unit took to start is printed after the "+" character.

multi-user.target @2.188s
â””â”€kdump.service @1.287s +899ms
  â””â”€NetworkManager.service @1.202s +82ms
    â””â”€dbus.service @1.197s
      â””â”€basic.target @1.195s
        â””â”€sockets.target @1.195s
          â””â”€dbus.socket @1.195s
```

## Getting close to the edge

It's time to get creative now - what's left for optimizing?
Everything after this is arguably a hack, much more than the previous changes.

### Disabling non-essential services

Let's just disable everything which isn't actually needed to get the system up.

`apparmor.service`:
Used for system hardening. If the system is not security relevant
(e.g. an isolated VM), this can be disabled. Not recommended though.

`rebootmgr.service`:
If a reboot is scheduled (e.g. by the automatic transactional-update.timer),
it triggers an automatic reboot in the configured timeframe (default 3:30am).
If the system is rebooted manually, this can be disabled.

`kdump.service`:
Loads a kernel and initrd for kernel coredumping into RAM. Unless
the system is a highly critical production machine and every crash has to be analyzed,
this can be disabled.

With those changes applied:

```
# systemd-analyze 
Startup finished in 1.899s (kernel) + 1.505s (userspace) = 3.405s
# systemd-analyze blame
629ms systemd-journald.service            
532ms systemd-logind.service              
480ms dev-vda3.device                     
479ms dev-vda2.device                     
303ms systemd-hostnamed.service
```

Over a second saved again. systemd-analyze tells us that there's not much left in
userspace to optimize.

### Kernel configuration

Currently the kernel takes quite a long time during boot for benchmarking some algorithms.
This is done so that it knows which of the available implementations is the quickest on the
system it's running on.
Ironically, this means that on CPUs with new features it actually takes a bit longer.
If performance for RAID6 is not important, this can simply be disabled by setting
`CONFIG_RAID6_PQ_BENCHMARK=n`

After building such a kernel and installing it:

```
# systemd-analyze 
Startup finished in 1.083s (kernel) + 1.356s (userspace) = 2.439s
```

This saves almost a second during kernel startup.

### Direct kernel boot

The bootloader takes some time during boot as well (boot menu, kernel loading), which can be optimized
as well. Apart from the obvious option to decrease the time the boot menu is shown (or hiding it by default),
it's also possible to skip it altogether! By supplying the kernel and cmdline from the VM host, booting can be
even quicker. This is only a good idea in setups where there is a custom kernel build with everything built-in
though, as otherwise it may happen that the modules in the VM get out of sync with the kernel image supplied by
the VM host. This also breaks automatic rollbacks (health-checker needs GRUB for that) and selecting old
snapshots to boot from.

I'm not aware of a way to measure the time it takes to load the kernel, so no measurement here. This mostly
removes the time which systemd-analyze doesn't show (on non-EFI systems).

## Conclusion

Getting from 25.958s to 2.439s (with hacks) means that over 90% of boot time can be optimized away.

The next task is to push those optimizations into the distro and make them the default or at least easy to
apply.

Have a lot of fun!
